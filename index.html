    <p> <b>  Each of the beat that was carried in each song of EZU, very dynamic, coupled with a touch or the sound of New Wave Rock so comfortable to hear and have a varied rhythm in every song. EZU plays in a harmony of synthesizer and music programming to generate Elctronic element that is brought with the help of the guitar that gives a work in beautiful music to be heard, or seen a live stage action with those who are attractive. Supported by a strong vocal character and easy to sing along, as well as themes of the lyrics that carries the spirit of togetherness and a strong friendship, nature, sportsmanship, and love that is able to anesthetize everyone who heard and saw action stage EZU to sing together.</b></p>
